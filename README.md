beeplotR
========

## Introduction
The beeswarm plot is a one-dimensional scatter plot like "stripchart", but with closely-packed, non-overlapping points. This packages provides a wrapper around the original beeswarm package written by Aron Eklund. This means that the original functions are not modified in any way or form.
